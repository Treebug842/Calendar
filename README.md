# Calendar
Pretty basic calendar program built for windows. It shows all 366 days (2020 is a leap year) and you are able switch between months easily, change colours of the days, and add notes to the days. If you click on a day, the current entry will show up, click edit to be able to change the colour (press the colour you want) and input text and click save. Not very complex but its simplicity is why I like it.
